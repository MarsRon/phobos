The not so cool multi-purpose dumb Discord bot.\
Phobos has zero uses except playing music and other cool but useless stuff.\
It includes commands for Fun, Economy, Music, Moderation, Utility and more.\
If you liked this open-source project, adding a star on this repository will be greatly appreciated.

## Self-hosting

**NOTE: SELF-HOSTING ISN'T COMPLETED YET**

### Creating a Bot and adding it to your server

1. Create a new application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with your bot's name.
2. In the `Bot` tab, create a new bot.
3. Under `Privileged Gateway Intents`, Enable `PRESENCE INTENT` and `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`.
4. Copy the bot `ID` and paste it into [this website](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#8589934591) to get your bot's invite link.
5. Copy the bot `Token`, we will use it later. **This is similar to the password of your bot, do not leak it.**

For a more complete guide, please look at [Discord.py's guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) or [Discord.js's guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html).
