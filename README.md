The not so cool multi-purpose dumb Discord bot.\
Phobos has zero uses except playing music and other cool but useless stuff.\
It includes commands for Fun, Economy, Music, Moderation, Utility and more.\
If you liked this open-source project, adding a star on this repository will be greatly appreciated.

## Self-hosting

**NOTE: SELF-HOSTING ISN'T COMPLETED YET**\
Yeah basically this bot isn't documented very well. Hopefully it will be customizable enough in the future.
