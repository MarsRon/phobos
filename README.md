# Phobos

Stupid discord.js bot by MarsRon with even worse code.

Phobos has zero uses except playing music and other cool but useless stuff.\
It includes commands for Fun, Economy, Music, Moderation, Utility and more.

## Features

- Music system - Thanks to [DisTube][distube]
- Bad economy system
- Stupid word catchers
- Some other trash commands

Note: The source code was not created to be a template, but for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want, but this code was not written with the intention of being cloned and deployed. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for doing that. I recommend learning to make your own bot from [discordjs.guide][discordjs.guide] or clone other open-sourced projects.
